# TrueVolume for YouTube

> Smooth, natural volume control for YouTube.

## Overview
YouTube's built-in volume slider adjusts sound in a **linear** way — but our ears don't work like that.
We perceive loudness **logarithmically**, meaning small changes at low volume can feel huge, while big changes at high volume can feel barely noticeable.

**TrueVolume for YouTube** re-maps the slider to match human hearing, so every adjustment feels **even, predictable, and precise**.

## Features
- 🎧 **Natural loudness control** — no more “too quiet” or “too loud” jumps
- 🚀 **Works instantly** on all YouTube videos
- ⚡ **Lightweight & private** — zero unnecessary permissions

## Why It Matters
With a linear slider, the volume scale is unintuitive:
- Low volumes: each step feels *too big*
- High volumes: each step feels *too small*

TrueVolume applies a **logarithmic curve**, evening out the steps so the loudness change always matches your ears' expectations.
